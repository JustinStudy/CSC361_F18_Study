I plan to build a 2d platformer game similair to CanyonBunny. The game will be based around internet/meme culture.
The main character will have a few presets that the player can choose from. Movement will be left, right, jump, climb ladders,
and falling. There will be enemies that the character can fire projectiles at. High score will be determined by a mixture
of accuracy, time taken to complete the level, and reductions on lives lost.  Character will move through one long level with
different enemies spawning along the way.
